## Description

Simple relay designs for use in DIY effects pedals.

This repository contains:

* A gerber file to produce the PCB.
* A gerber file to produce the PCB with a location specified for the production number if using JLCPCB.

There is no support supplied or guaranteed for the PCB. I have built it and it works, YMMV.

## Simple relay v1.1

Through-hole implementation of a [design by Chuck D. Bones](https://forum.pedalpcb.com/threads/a-simple-relay-bypass.16474/) at the [PedalPCB forums](https://forum.pedalpcb.com/).

This is based around the Fujitsu [FTR-B3A4.5](https://www.fcl.fujitsu.com/downloads/MICRO/fcai/relays/ftr-b3.pdf) and [FTR-B4A4.5](https://www.fcl.fujitsu.com/downloads/MICRO/fcai/relays/ftr-b4.pdf) signal relays. Either can be used.
